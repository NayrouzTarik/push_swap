Sorting a stack

a stack is a data structure type that follow the logic of LIFO which means the last in is the first out
we can see it as a closed box from the bottom and open from the top and to get the last element in the box
i must remove the first element to get to the last

operations :
    -swap : ss : simultaneously swaping nodes of A and B at the same time
            sa : swap the first two nodes in A
            sb : swap the first two nodes in B

    -rotate : ra : bring the first node to be the last node of A
              rb : bring the first node to be the last node of B and the rest nodes go upper
              rr : rotating A and B at the same time

    -push : pa : pushing the top node of B in A
            pb : pushing the top node of A in B


    -reverse rotate : rra : bring the bottom node from A to the top of A
                      rrb : bring the bottom node from B to the top of B
                      rrr : rotating A and B at the same time

what is Parsing?
Parsing is passing arguments from the command line and they must be converted using some functions to a suitable format in our case a doubly linked list
